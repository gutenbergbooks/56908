<p>When we consider that the obligations of benevolence, which are
founded on the precepts and examples of the Author of Christianity,
are not cancelled by the follies or crimes of our fellow-creatures:
and when we reflect upon the miseries which penury, hunger, cold,
unnecessary severity, unwholesome apartments, and guilt, (the usual
attendants of prisons,) involve with them, it becomes us to extend
our compassion to that part of mankind who are the subjects of
those miseries. By the aid of humanity, their undue and illegal
sufferings may be prevented; the links which should bind the whole
family of mankind together, under all circumstances, be preserved
unbroken; and such degrees and modes of punishment may be discovered
and suggested, as may, instead of continuing habits of vice,
become the means of restoring our fellow-creatures to virtue and
happiness. From a conviction of the truth and obligation of these
principles, the subscribers have associated themselves under the title
of “<span class="smcap">The Philadelphia Society for Alleviating the Miseries of
Public Prisons</span>.”</p>

<p>For effecting these purposes, they have adopted the following
<span class="smcap">Constitution</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Article I.</span>&mdash;The officers of the Society shall consist of a President,
two Vice-Presidents, two Secretaries, a Treasurer, two Counsellors,
and an Acting Committee, all of whom, except the Acting
Committee, shall be chosen annually, by ballot, on the second
Second-day, called Monday, in the month called January.</p>

<p>We need, in some parts of the United States, a grade of penal
institutions between what are called Houses of Refuge, or of
Reformation for Juvenile Delinquents on the one hand, and the
highest and best class of penitentiaries on the other.</p>

<p>As they are at present, our institutions of this class are neither
schools nor prisons. They employ the inmates at labor and
instruct them, as far as practicable, in the elements of useful
knowledge and thus far they resemble the Industrial Schools
of Europe. But they are places of close confinement&mdash;they
have regulations and a police, not unlike those of a prison, and
their inmates are sent thither as <i>offenders</i>&mdash;though <i>juvenile</i>
offenders. The worst that can be said of some of them is,
that they are incorrigible truants&mdash;of others, that they are past
parental control, (and in this respect, perhaps, “more sinned
against than sinning;”) but some are adroit thieves and bold
burglars&mdash;some skilful forgers&mdash;some incendiaries, and some
assaulters with intent to kill. Their ages, too, range from
eight to sixteen or even eighteen, and their size and physical
strength are equally various.</p>

<p>This is a motley group to bring into the relation of schoolmates
or fellow-apprentices, and their care-takers must possess
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
rare endowments, so to administer discipline, as to prevent
much harm from being done to some in connection with all the
good they do to others. For, that they have done immeasurable
good, no one who has investigated their operations and
results, can for a moment doubt. They have fully justified the
high anticipations which were entertained concerning them at
an early period of their history. “No disciplinary institution in
our country,” said the Rev. Dr. Alexander of New Jersey,
“promises to effect more for society, than a House of Refuge
for juvenile delinquents. If it were ever lawful to rejoice in
an event produced by crime, it would be, that these unhappy
youth are, by the commission of a crime, snatched from the
sink of pollution in which they have been immersed, and put
to regular business, and educated as well as most children in
the land.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>Having fully sustained their claim to confidence, as a system
of reformatory means, we naturally desire to see them
rendered as effective as possible. And to this end we would
have them adhere punctiliously to the original design for which
they were instituted. This was not to inflict a penalty, but to
interpose a shield&mdash;not to bring suffering upon the guilty,
but to supply instruction, wholesome discipline and kind offices
to the neglected and exposed. They may easily be perverted
by opening their doors to youth (“young in years, but old in
sinning”) who are thought to require some milder discipline
than the penitentiary affords, but whose offences are really as
rank and as indicative of deep-seated depravity as those of the
oldest and the worst.</p>

<p>In determining, in any given case, whether to admit or reject
an applicant, the managers of a House of Refuge would
be governed, we presume, chiefly by the <i>character</i>, though in
some degree by the size and physical strength of the individual,
as a subject of mild, parental discipline. The question, how
far a residence in the institution will be likely to bring about
his radical reformation and the establishment of good habits
has the first place; and another, and scarcely less important
question would be, what influence will his admission have on
others? If he is perverse and stubborn, and at the same time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
overgrown in size, so as require a disproportionate measure
of care and vigilance, (in which case other and more hopeful
subjects must be, to an equal extent, neglected,) his admission
would seem inexpedient. Provision exists, or should be made
for such an one elsewhere. So, also, if one is presented, deformed
in body, deficient in mind, or of sickly constitution, and
not likely to succeed in acquiring the knowledge of a trade,
or unfitted to bear the proper discipline, he has higher claims
on some other form of public charity. A House of Refuge is
not meant for him, nor is it likely to benefit him.</p>

<p>An institution designed to keep boys and girls in due order
and subordination, ought to be able to dispense with some of
the more revolting appendages of a prison&mdash;such as unscaleable
walls&mdash;narrow stone cells&mdash;and massive bars and bolts.
We admit that all these are necessary the moment it receives
a sturdy, hardened, hackneyed rogue of eighteen, sixteen or even
fourteen; but it is a pity to force upon the whole establishment
the gloomy appearance of a prison, rather than reject
half a dozen youth of extra age and size, whom parents or
friends naturally feel disposed to save from a felon’s doom.</p>

<p>The inquiry of chief interest, however, relates to <i>character</i>.
What has been his career up to this time? Who have
been his associates? To what species of crime has he been
chiefly addicted? Has he, in the fury of unbridled passion, attempted
the life of another? of his parent, or associate, or
enemy? Has he deliberately forged another’s name? Has
he been familiar with scenes of outrage and tumult? Is he a
frequenter of the haunts of infamy? Has he good fellowship
with a large circle of like characters with himself? These
questions, or any of them, if answered affirmatively, would go
far to turn the scale against his admission. The acts we have
supposed, indicate in the perpetrator of them, a confirmed habit
or propensity, which may, perhaps, be corrected; but not by the
ordinary discipline of a proper House of Refuge. Nor should the
attempt be made to employ it on so unpromising a subject, at
the risk of introducing more evil than we can possibly hope to
prevent. Indeed, it is difficult to conceive any good reason why
a burglar or incendiary at sixteen, should be called a “delinquent,”
and put to school, while the same grade of criminals
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
at twenty, are called convicts, and sent to the penitentiary.
Age, by itself, is a very unsafe criterion by which to determine
the turpitude of crime or the appropriateness of punishment.</p>

<p>We do not say that no cases of this class can occur, in which
the admission of the party to a House of Refuge, would be expedient;
but, as a general thing, we should be disposed to confine
its benign influence to those whose proclivity to a criminal
career is but feebly though decidedly developed; whose
delinquencies exist rather in an impatience or contempt of domestic
restraints, than in deliberate violations of public law.
The discipline, as well as the construction of Refuge-buildings
and the usual means of safe custody, evidently contemplate a very
young class of boys and girls, say from eight to twelve years of
age, who may be incorrigible truants, disobedient to parents,
insubordinate to masters, petty thieves, street-strollers, without
a home or worse,&mdash;uneducated, unaccustomed to any kind
of restraint. Such youth come under the discipline of an
establishment, like our Houses of Refuge, with a prospect of
great advantage.</p>

<p>Even those who have acquired fixed habits of lying, stealing,
deceit and violence, are, at this age, physically reducible
to order and industry. They are incapable of using dangerous
weapons with effect&mdash;they are not likely to combine for outbreaks,
nor to plot escapes. With wholesome food, and an
hour or two’s recreation every day, they can be made to
conform to stringent regulations, without great or long continued
severity of discipline. Active employment in some handicraft,
daily schooling, and proper religious culture, soon work
a wonderful transformation in such a class of children, and if
they can only be continued long enough to make their new
course of life <i>habitual</i>, so that to be idle shall be as irksome to
them as it once was to work, and to speak the truth shall be
as easy as it once was to lie, the benefit of such an institution
could not be overrated.</p>

<p>If the discrimination we have suggested, should be faithfully
observed, we should find a very large class of youth who
require penal discipline of a severer type, and for whom no
provision is now made except in the penitentiary, which is
quite as ill adapted to meet the exigency at this point, as the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
Refuge is at the other. We should, therefore, be disposed to
take the most promising youthful inmates of the penitentiary,
and the least suitable or most unpromising of the older inmates
of some of the Houses of Refuge for juvenile delinquents, and
provide an institution for them, that shall combine the severity
of the former with the leniency of the latter. This idea is
substantially embraced in the Parkhurst prison on the Isle of
Wight, and is recognized to some extent in the new State Reform
School at Westborough, Massachusetts.</p>

<p>The origin and peculiarities of these institutions, involve the
vast and interesting subject of juvenile delinquency; its causes,
effects and preventives, upon an investigation of which we
promise ourselves some future opportunity to enter. As it is,
our limits require us to pass abruptly to a few general remarks
upon the present condition of our principal institutions designed
for its correction.</p>

<p>From the twenty-first report of the Philadelphia House of
Refuge, we learn, that during the year 1848, one hundred and
sixty-eight inmates were received, (129 boys and 39 girls,)
and 153 discharged, (116 boys, and 37 girls,) of whom, 89
were by indentures. Of the commitments, 86 were by request
of parents or near friends. The average age of both sexes
was a fraction over 14 years; but so far as the prospect of
reformation is concerned, a girl is as old at 14 as a boy is at
18. There was only one death in the House during the year.
Of the 65 boys indentured, 30 went to farmers; and of the 24
girls all were indentured to housewifery. The occupations of
the inmates are, cane-chair seating, (48,) umbrella furniture,
(57,) and razor-strop making, (71.) The income from the
labor of boys during the year, was $5,598,88, and the total
expenditures of the establishment, were $13,987,39. The principal
of this institution has, at our request, furnished some
valuable suggestions respecting the methods of administration
and discipline, in establishments of this class, of which we
gladly avail ourselves in the present connection.</p>

<p>He ranks classification, among the most obvious, important
and difficult objects to be attained in such an institution.
He admits that education, moral, intellectual, and religious, is
all important; but he insists, that habits of industry and obedience,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
should be regarded as among the first and most desirable
fruits of it. The power of habit, he thus forcibly describes:</p>

<p>“A boy, who has been unaccustomed to obey his parents, or
respect his superiors, and has been allowed to spend most of
his time in idleness before he is brought to the Refuge, if kept
regularly at work, and at the same time compelled to obey
those who have the care of him, will, in time, become so accustomed
to labor, that he will even, in some cases, prefer it
to idleness, and obedience will also become habitual. But this
must be a work of time. He should be kept until he is thoroughly
weaned from his former indolent ways. I have known
boys who have remained three or four years in our institution
and who have run away from their masters soon after they
were bound out, come back to the city and resort to their old
haunts and habits; but finding few if any of their old associates,
they have soon felt that their former habits were not so pleasant,
and having lost all relish for a vagabond life, have voluntarily
returned to the house and asked admission and employment
as a boon!”</p>

<p>He justly animadverts upon the unreasonableness of those who
expect “a House of Refuge will accomplish, in a few months,
what respectable and even religious parents find it difficult to
do even in a series of years.” They have their children from
the first hour of their existence, and through all that precious
period of childhood, while they are comparatively strangers to
evil habits and associations, and yet how often do they fail to
secure their standing in good habits and sound principles?
How preposterous then, must be the expectation that the House
of Refuge will take them, when their moral and intellectual
nature is so completely perverted and corrupted, and thoroughly
reform them in a few months!</p>

<p>Touching the employment of boys in the institution, and
after they leave it, many difficulties are experienced. The
modes of labor which are adopted, are, of course, fitted to the
age and physical ability of such children, but are by no means
calculated to prepare them for that sort of life, which most of
them expect to lead. To remove them completely from the
temptations and exposures of city life, is considered very desirable;
and hence, to place them with farmers in the country,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
where the means of indulging vicious inclinations are supposed
to be few and far between, is always preferred to placing them
with mechanics, where they will be likely to find associates
who will be the subjects or agents of corruption. But to bind
a boy to a farmer till he is of age, is regarded by most parents
as a very undesirable disposition to make of him, and
when a boy is thus bound, he generally understands that his
parents or friends will readily connive at his escape. The
general wish is, that they should be bound to trades, if bound
at all.</p>

<p>It seems to be admitted that, as a general thing, city boys
are not likely to make good farmers, unless put to it very
young, and by degrees accustomed to hard work. “The routine
of labor pursued in the Refuge, does not seem fitted to prepare
boys for that kind of life, to which the greater part of them
are destined. A boy here, works from five to seven hours a
day at very light work, in a room that is warmed and made
comfortable in winter, and sheltered from the wet and heat of
summer. He has from one to two hours for play every day,
and an abundance of playmates. After living in this way
about one year, (sometimes a little less, and sometimes more
than a year,) he is bound to a farmer, who makes him work,
perhaps ten or twelve hours in a day, and at labor which is
much harder than any thing he has been accustomed to before.
He has, perhaps, repeatedly been told, while in the Refuge, to
behave well, and he should soon have a good place, and it has
been told in such a way, that to be with a farmer is, in his
mind, to be in a kind of paradise. But when he finds hard
work, no time for play, frequent exposure to heat and cold,
few or no companions, it is not strange that some are disappointed
and disposed to abscond.”</p>

<p>In contrast with this mode of proceeding, our correspondent
proposes the following outline. “If it were possible,” he says, “I
would keep every boy at least three years, and I would have
him understand, when he comes into the Refuge, that he must
not expect to be discharged in less than three years, so that his
mind should be at ease on that point. I would have them employed
at trades, that would be useful to them after their discharge.
In three years they would acquire so much knowledge
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
of a common trade, that their services would become desirable
to respectable mechanics. In three years, if properly disciplined,
their habits of industry, obedience, &amp;c., would acquire
a degree of strength. They would become weaned from
their old associates and habits. In three years the older ones, (if
too old for apprentices,) would become sufficiently acquainted
with their business to earn their living. Their parents would
not feel that their time was lost. They would see, and the
boys themselves would see, that they are acquiring that sort of
knowledge that will be useful to them in after life. Many of
our older boys think now, that their time is in a good degree
lost. They know, indeed, that the intellectual education they
acquire will be of service to them, but they feel, at the same
time, that they are not learning any thing that will secure
them a livelihood after their discharge.”</p>

<p>Among the obvious evils of a short continuance in the Refuge,
(besides the impracticability of forming new habits in the children,)
are, (1.) The state of constant restlessness in the alternation
of hope and disappointment, respecting a release.
Parents are permitted to visit their children once in two
months, and in these visits the principal subject of conversation
is about their “getting out.” The children are constantly
urging their parents to have them released, and the parents
are equally constant in promising to do so. This excites much
uneasiness in the former, and neutralizes what would otherwise
be the useful discipline of the house; and, (2.) The institution
is deprived of the fruits of its good discipline as fast,
nearly, as they appear. “By constantly sending out the best,
we lose their influence, which might be of much service with
the more vicious. If, in any community, the best members
were constantly leaving, and only bad members coming in to
supply their places, the condition of that community, with regard
to morals, would become very low, if not hopeless.”</p>

<p>These opinions, formed from an intimate acquaintance with
the practical working of the system, are entitled to weight.
We do not adopt nor reject them. We do not say that any
material modification of the present rules of admission, or of
the form of discipline is practicable. But, if the views we
have ever held respecting the design of a House of Refuge are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
just, viz., to rescue those whose childhood lies all <i>open to evil
examples and influences, and to put them under treatment, which
shall resemble, in its main features, that of a good home</i>, then
are we clear, that a more rigid discrimination in the admission
of inmates should be observed. The most hopeful subjects
of such domestic discipline, are those who have not past into
that stage of moral and intellectual stupor and impenetrability,
on which ordinary sympathies fall as water-drops upon a marble
slab. Notwithstanding the sad neglects and abuses they
have suffered, there are still impulses in their young natures,
which can be worked upon by kind words and approving
smiles, and indeed, their present unhappy condition is owing,
in no small measure, to the absence of such influences from the
place which (for want of a better) they call their <i>home</i>. We
have known cases, not a few, in which the manifestation of a
real interest in the welfare of a child at a favorable moment,
has been, in its effects, like the gushing forth of a living spring
from the smitten rock. And it is in this view, that we most
highly commend a recent measure in the institution, whose
report is now under review, viz., the employment of an intelligent,
judicious, capable female, to supervise with maternal
care and tenderness the moral and physical condition of the
boys.</p>

<p>We all know with how many chords the human heart is
strung, which vibrate only to the soft breath of sympathy.
A gentle accent&mdash;a trifling act of kindness, or even a glance of
pity, will awaken their harmonies, and fill the heart of the rudest
child with what may well pass for rapture. There is a period,
however, at which these better feelings become comparatively
incapable of excitement. They have either lost their vitality
by abuse or neglect, or they have been overborne and swallowed
up by the ebbless tide of vicious associations and indulgencies.
The voice of virtuous charmers is no longer heard,
charm they never so wisely.</p>

<p>But we cannot enlarge on this fruitful topic, suffice it to say
that some of the defects of the present system are remediable,
as we have already intimated, and others are inseparable from
the very nature and design of the institution, and can only
be set over against the greater good.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span></p>

<p>The report furnishes a very gratifying account of the progress
which has been made in the erection of a new Refuge for
Colored Juvenile Delinquents. A front view and ground plan
of the structure accompanying our present number and the following
general description of the arrangement of the various
departments, may be interesting to our readers.</p>

<p>The site embraces eleven acres of ground, and is intended
to afford ample room, (at some future time,) for a new Refuge
for white children. The lot lies in the form of a parallelogram,
400 feet by 210, and is enclosed by a wall varying in height
from 20½ to 30 feet.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The arrangement of the buildings within the enclosure,
which are all of brick, with slate roofs, is made with reference
to a total separation of the boys and girls, and to the existence
of three separate classes of both male and female inmates: the
first (or best) and second classes each to have a play-ground
and work-room, and the members of one class not to be allowed
to converse with those of the other, on any occasion; the
third class, consisting of the most depraved inmates, to be kept,
until in a condition to warrant promotion to a higher class, in
separate confinement, with a suitable allowance of out of door
exercise for the preservation of health, said exercise to be
taken in an enclosure specially designed for this purpose,
where no conversation between the inmates shall be permitted.</p>

<p>“The numbers of these three classes which can be accommodated
when the buildings marked on the plan shall be erected,
as ultimately designed, are&mdash;</p>

<p>“The erection of all of the other buildings specified in the
plan, was authorized, with reference to the accommodation of
250 inmates. They consist of&mdash;</p>

<p>“1. A main building, three stories in height, containing
offices and chambers for the officers, school-rooms and infirmaries
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
for the male and female inmates, a dining and sitting-room
for the girls, &amp;c.</p>

<p>“2. Two buildings projecting from the rear of the main
building; the one in the male department, two stories in height,
and containing the chapel and the boys’ dining-room; the other
in the female department, three stories in height, and appropriated
for the kitchen, the wash-room, store-rooms, &amp;c.</p>

<p>“3. Two wings, each three stories in height; the one, in
the female department, containing the dormitories and bathing-rooms
for the girls; the other, in the male department, containing
the boys’ dormitories.</p>

<p>“4. A building, two stories in height, near the southern wall
of the male department, the first and second stories of which
are designed for work-rooms, and the basement for a washing
and bathing-room for the boys.</p>

<p>“A corridor, 12 feet in width, extends the whole length of
the main building and wings, a distance of 243 feet.</p>

<p>“Many important points, in addition to the classification of
the inmates, claimed the attention of the Board, in the preparation
of the plan&mdash;<i>e.&nbsp;g.</i> security against the escape of the inmates,
and their constant supervision by an officer at all times
of the day; the proper ventilation and warming of all the
apartments; provision for out of door exercise for the inmates
in all states of the weather, &amp;c. These, it is believed, have
all been kept in view and provided for, in the plan adopted.</p>

<p>“The wall of enclosure, excepting the gate-way and a portion
of the pointing, is completed; the work-shop is finished;
and of all the other buildings the walls are up, the roofs on,
and a small part of the flooring laid.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Extracting flues, connecting with shafts leading to the external
air, have been inserted in all the dormitories and other
rooms, to ensure a good ventilation at all times; and suitable
arrangements have also been made for heating the different
apartments. We trust the Managers have succeeded in securing
these two most important requisites to the health (physical
and moral) of their new institution. A full supply of good
water, fresh air and wholesome warmth, is what every institution
of the kind wants; and yet in one or more of them almost
all are deficient.</p>

<p>The second document, at the head of the present article,
shows a prosperous state of the institution of which it treats.
The whole number of children and youth who have found
refuge within its walls is 4,397. Of these, 568 were under its
care, at different periods, during the year 1848. The number
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
remaining January 1, 1849, was 355; and 213 were disposed
of during the year. The chief branches of labor are, making
and seating chair frames and manufacturing razor strops.
Among the improvements of the year is the introduction of a
small steam engine, to relieve the severity of some parts of the
labor, which is not unfrequently prejudicial to the immature
strength of the inmates.</p>

<p>The disbursements of the year amounted to $22,896 10, and
the receipts $24,122 32. Of the latter sum, $7,198 77 is from
the labor of the inmates, $7,323 83 from the State, $4,600 from
the city of New York, and $4,026 50 from theatre and circus
licenses. The chief items of expense were food and provisions,
$9,106 41; salaries, $4,875 89; clothing, $2,297 90.</p>

<p>The importance of more perfect classification and separation,
especially among the female inmates, is urged. “Contact
with the older and more depraved of their sex, is, for obvious
reasons, far more destructive to young and comparatively
innocent females than to males.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>In confirmation of the views we have presented in a former
part of this article, we cite the following passage from the
report now before us.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“This is the proper place to allude to a practice of which
we have already complained more than once&mdash;that of sending
to the Refuge, from mistaken ideas of humanity, subjects
so far advanced in years and in crime as to give but faint
hopes of their own reformation, while by example and influence
they are calculated to do infinite harm to others. Those
who have travelled long and far on the downward road of
vice, are most unfit companions for such as have been arrested
at the outset of their guilty career. It is to guide and to
reclaim the latter, that houses of refuge are established; the
reformation of the former must be attempted in other places
and by other means. To this practice of sending to the refuge
hardened offenders, whose proper place is a State prison, the
managers ascribe the frequency of attempts to escape. Many
sent to us as boys, are men in size and strength, impatient of
restraint, reckless of consequences, hardened, daring and ingenious
in all mischief. While such subjects are sent us, to corrupt,
to organize, and to lead the younger and more orderly,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
attempts at escape will continue to be made, and in spite of all
the vigilance of the officers, will occasionally be successful.</p>

<p>“The rapid increase of crime in our city, and the constantly
augmenting numbers of vicious and vagrant youth, is a subject
of serious contemplation. It would be serious enough, if
it only kept pace with the astonishing increase of our population,
but it even outstrips it. There is no way of getting at
complete statistics in this matter, but all the details that can be
obtained confirm this view. Thus there were committed to
prison in the city, including those sent before trial, and after
sentence, and excluding summary convictions,</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>in 1835,</td>
    <td class="tdr">2387 persons,</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>in 1844,</td>
    <td class="tdr">9153 persons.</td>
  </tr></table>

<p>During this time the population increased from 270,089 to
312,710 (in 1845) or about 35.1 per cent., while the increase
in crime was 354.6 per cent. The average number of inmates
in the Tombs was, in 1846, 174; in 1848, 216, an increase of
21.2 per cent. in two years, or over three times the growth of
the city, which of late was about 6.90 per cent. for two years.
This startling disproportion, is more or less true of all large
cities. It is a law of our social state, that growing prosperity
shall find its drawback in the parallel increase of misery; and
that crowded communities, as they offer the most liberal rewards
to good conduct and enterprise, so shall contain likewise
the most seeds of evil, the strongest temptations to vice, the
largest amount of misery. And besides our own neglected and
depraved population, the tide of emigration, now setting in
stronger and stronger every year, while it enriches our country,
leaves much of its refuse in our city. Pauper families,
and even felons, are not unfrequently sent over to us, as a cheap
way of disposing of them, by the selfishness or mistaken humanity
of those whose duty it is to provide for them at home,
thus swelling the number of houseless, friendless and lawless
youth, drifting loose upon society, to become utterly ship-wrecked,
unless the active hand of benevolence is stretched
out to save them.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Of those children received in 1848, 209 were boys, (192
white and 17 colored,) and 55 were girls, (45 white and 10
colored.) 140 of the whole number were from the Police and
Sessions of the city, and of the white children only <small>THIRTY-NINE</small>
were of American parentage. 127 were of Irish birth!
Of 141 boys discharged, 53 were indentured to farmers, 14 to
shoemakers, and 19 sent to sea; and of 47 girls discharged, 33
were indentured to housewifery. The average age of the inmates
received during 1848, was thirteen and two and a half
twelfths years. Seventy-seven were over fifteen when received.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span></p>

<p><i>New House of Refuge at Rochester.</i>&mdash;Our readers are perhaps
aware, that an institution similar to the present House of
Refuge in New York, is about to be established in Rochester
for the accommodation of the Western counties of the State. A
friend has kindly furnished us with the following description
of the buildings, &amp;c. Mr. Wood, the present superintendent
of the New York House of Refuge, is expected to take charge
of the new establishment, and the discipline will probably be
substantially the same. An appropriation is expected at the
present session of the legislature, that will enable inmates to
be received this spring. No provision is yet made for females.</p>

<p>“At present,” says our correspondent, “they have only
erected a main or centre building and one wing. The whole
length of this building is 234 feet. Main building 86 by 60 feet.
Wing 148 by 32 feet, terminated by a building 37 feet square.
The basement of stone, 10 feet in the clear, walls above
of brick. The basement in the main building is intended for
the culinary department; that in the wing for wash-rooms,
bathing-room and workshops. The first and second floors of
the main building are divided into four rooms, with suitable
closets, and three halls, with staircases. The main hall in the
centre is 15 feet wide; side halls to communicate with the wings
12 feet wide. The rooms on the first floor of the main building
are intended for superintendent, matron, &amp;c. The rooms
on second story for hospitals and sleeping-rooms for the officers
of the institution. The upper or third story of main building
is intended for a chapel, 60 by 60 feet, the entrance to
which is from the side hall.</p>

<p>“The first story of the wing is divided into two rooms for
school and dining rooms, each 70 by 30 feet. In second story
of wing are the dormitories for the inmates, two tiers in height,
and 86 in number, arranged next the outside wall. Hall 15 feet
wide in the centre. Each dormitory is 7½ feet wide and 7½ feet
high, and is furnished with a narrow window reaching from
floor to ceiling. Dormitory doors are of cast-iron open work for
summer ventilation, allowing the air to pass directly across the
building; in addition, each dormitory is supplied with fresh air,
descending from the cornice by iron pipes, and passing through
the iron doors. This building is surrounded by a stone wall,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
four feet thick at the foundation and tapering to two feet at
the top, 23 feet from the foundation, and 20 feet above ground.
The wall is 500 feet long and 400 feet wide, embracing about
4½ acres of land, and cost $12,000. The building, as above
described, cost $26,000. The whole is a most perfect piece
of workmanship in every respect, built in the very best manner,
and is considered a most complete model for such a purpose.</p>

<p>“Attached are 40 acres of land, which it is intended the inmates
shall cultivate, thus affording them a healthy employment,
and, at the same time, furnishing a supply of vegetables,
&amp;c., to the institution. The buildings are situated about a
mile from the centre of business, in a fine dry sandy soil.”</p>

<p>We had prepared a sketch of the proceedings at the opening
of the State Reform School in Massachusetts, and of the
discipline, &amp;c., prescribed there, together with a view and
ground plan of the buildings, but our limits are so contracted
as to forbid its appearance in the present number.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/hr.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="Art_II"><span class="smcap">Art. II.</span>&mdash;MORTALITY AND CRIME.</h3>

<p>It is not generally known, although the fact has been sufficiently
demonstrated by different vital statisticians, that great
annual mortality is accompanied by a proportionate increase
of births, so that the population is kept at its usual average
even if it does not increase. One effect of this mortality and
increase of births is the disproportion between the numbers of
the young, the improvident, and the thoughtless, and the older,
more prudent and considerate. Mr. Slaney, in his report
on Birmingham and other towns, made to the commissioners
for inquiry into the state of large towns and populous districts,
after referring to Mr. Chadwick’s exposure of the popular fallacy,
that the sufferings caused by disease, especially among
the poor, restrained the increase of population, says: “I have
constantly observed, wherever the mortality was high in close,
narrow, neglected courts and alleys, there the children swarmed,
as if to fill up the places; and it has been demonstrated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
again and again, that a high mortality in an increasing country,
only leads to a great increase of births.” After this preliminary
notice, the reader will be able to understand the force
of the following remarks on the connection between mortality,
(including, of course, its physical and moral causes,) and crime.</p>

<p>Mr. Slaney contrasts the two classes or kinds of inhabitants
of the same city, in the one of which the annual
mortality is but two, and in the other four per cent. “We
shall find the rate of mortality one great criterion of comfort,
therefore, of contentment, of good conduct, of moral habits,
of intelligence, docility, usefulness and value.”</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“In the one case we shall find a population having little to
complain of, ready to attend to advice, having had time to
learn and to think, having experience from lengthened life, and
being valuable subjects, docile and industrious, possessing their
chief safe-guard against tumults or disorders, ‘the hope of improving
their condition.’ In the other will be found a body,
consisting in a great measure of the young, who cannot repay
their support; a large proportion of the rest will be inexperienced,
untaught, untried, having had no time to learn or to
think. All will be more or less reckless, and hard in mind and
conduct; they have been formed by the cautious course of circumstances
around them; poison to the mind, to the body, has
been the course of their only education. Their maxim will be
the heathen maxim of old, ‘Eat and drink, to-morrow we die;’
forced by their necessities to labor, experience and wisdom
will be wanting; they will not husband their wages, but seek
for excitement in intemperance, or low sensual indulgences;
their consumption of spirits will be ten times that of the happier
class. The gratification of their animal passions will be
their chief object; illicit connections will be formed; early ill
assorted marriages will take place without any chance of provision
for offspring; there will arise multitudes of sickly and
neglected children, pressing into the place of those early
victims just departed, and to be cut off by the same melancholy
process; and thus the scene revolves. This class will
eagerly join in mobs or disturbances, partly for the sake of
excitement, and because they have <i>not</i> that security for good
conduct&mdash;the hope of improving their condition.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Dr. Lyon Playfair, one of the commissioners, in his report
on the large town in Lancashire, remarks: “The tendency to
crime is increased by the comparatively few old and experienced
men left to counteract the haste and inexperience of
youth. In the recent mobs in Lancashire, the great majority
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
of the rioters were found to consist of persons just emerging
from boyhood; the absence of elderly persons among them was
a matter of common remark. Mr. Combe has observed, that
the comparative paucity of aged and cautious persons is the
cause of the inconsiderate and turbulent movements in America.
The obstacles in the spread of education are, also, connected
with these causes.”</p>

<p>Dr. Playfair said previously, “The facts exhibited in the
preceding sections, will, I apprehend, convincingly show, that
a crowded and unhealthy district, with all its inevitable accompaniments
of low morals and low intelligence&mdash;where the
condition of human beings is scarcely above that of animals&mdash;where
appetite and instinct occupy the place of the higher
feelings&mdash;where the lowest means of support encourage the
most improvident and early marriages,&mdash;is not the place where
we shall find a diminishing or even stationary population. For
the early unions there, are followed by early offspring; and
although more than half that offspring may be swept away by
disease during early infancy, yet nearly a third of it will grow
up, in spite of all the surrounding evils, to follow in the steps
of their parents, and in their turn to continue a race ignorant,
miserable and immoral as themselves.” In a note, Dr. Playfair
makes the following estimate. “If we suppose a district of
50,000 inhabitants, with births as 1 in 22, and deaths as 1 in
33&mdash;a ratio not actually as unfavorable as that of Holme&mdash;a
little calculation will show that, by the end of twelve years,
the population will have swollen it to nearly 60,000!”</p>

<p><i>Sameness of the Causes of Crime and of Disease.</i>&mdash;Dr. Lyon
Playfair, in the report already referred to, says expressly:
“All the experience acquired during this inquiry, points out
that one immediate effect of the operation of morbific causes,
even when not present in sufficient intensity to produce direct
disease, is to create an appetite for vicious indulgences. It is
too common a mistake to transpose the effect for the cause,
and to ascribe the disease to the indulgence of those passions,
which, in the first place, were created by the low sanatory
state of the district.”</p>

<p>To the same purport are the pointed conclusions of Mr.
Slaney. He had just been describing the low class of dwellings
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
of the poor and the wretched, and the self-interest of small
capitalists to prefer the erection of these to ones of a better
description. He goes on to say:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I have endeavored to describe some of the evils arising
from the want of proper sanatory regulations in many of these
crowded and neglected places. They may be summed up as
follows:</p>

<p>“1st. Shortening the duration of the lives of the community.</p>

<p>“2nd. Disease, suffering and inability to work on the part
of many who survive&mdash;the cause of great cost to the country.</p>

<p>“3d. Crimes, theft, and the loss of property, which the
police constantly point out as arising from these neglected
classes.</p>

<p>“4th. Riots, disturbances and drunkenness, which may generally
be traced to the same class of persons, often to the
same place.</p>

<p>“5th. Great injury to the education of the poor, which is
constantly neutralized in its good effects by the neglect and
evils they see around them. The same observation applies to
the inestimable advantages of religion and of attendance on
religious worship.</p>

<p>“6th. Great discontent in some, and sluggish apathy in
others, producing recklessness of conduct, indifference, and
want of attachment to the institutions of our country.</p>

<p>“7th. The loss in the humbler classes of the cheapest, best
and most enduring pleasures, viz., those arising from the
kindly influence of the domestic relations between husbands
and wives, parents and children, brothers and sisters&mdash;this
pure source of happiness derived from mutual kindness, attachment
and good offices&mdash;is, amid the hardening and disgusting
scenes described, almost destroyed.</p>

<p>“Amid such scenes, the children become hardened, careless
of cleanliness, unused to order, and all the benefits derived
from the best education which may be given, is destroyed by
the constant evil examples they see around their homes. This
is especially the case with the female sex, who, if early tainted
by the disgusting scenes existing in the places described, and by
the want of all decency and self-respect there exhibited, become
at a future day, the nursing mothers of vice and wretchedness,
instead of inculcating the household virtues.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The sameness of the causes of diseases and of crime, are
clearly indicated by the Rev. Mr. Clay in his report in the
borough of Preston, as where he says:&mdash;</p><blockquote>

<p>“A map of the town has been made, shaded in those districts
which are ill ventilated, drained and cleaned; the increased
depth of tint indicating a proportionate degree of dirtiness, &amp;c.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
The number of deaths in the respective streets is also given,
every blue spot representing a death from fever or epidemic
disease, and the red spots showing the frequency of death from
other disorders. The residences of persons charged with
offences during the last year are also indicated, and the whole
tends to show, that dirt, disease and crime are concurrent.”</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Overcrowding and Defective Ventilation.</i>&mdash;Dr. Southwood
Smith, in his evidence before the commissioners for “<i>Inquiring
into the state of large towns and populous districts</i>,” adduces
the following painful, but yet instructive observations. We
reproduce them here, not merely as a warning against a remote,
or even a threatened evil, but with the hope of stimulating our
fellow-citizens to the adoption of such measures as shall eradicate
similar nuisances too near their own doors.</p><blockquote>

<p>“I wish particularly,” Dr. S. Smith states, “to draw attention
to the importance of having a certain number of rooms in
the dwelling-houses of the poor, though I am aware of the difficulty
of legislating on this matter, and of the still greater
difficulty of carrying out practically what the legislature may
declare to be its intention and will. Still it is right, that the
attention of the legislature and other public bodies should be
called to the physical deterioration and moral degradation,
which results from the want of proper room in the dwelling-houses
of the poor. Besides the evidence on this subject,
which has been published in the report on the sanitary condition
of the laboring population, a large mass of evidence to the
same effect will be found in the reports of the sub-commissioners
under the Children’s Employment Commission, and in the
statements of a great number of witnesses examined by them.
Instances such as the following are given: ‘A mother and her
son, being an adult, sleep in the same bed. Grown-up females
and unmarried young men sleep in the same room. A man,
his wife, and his wife’s sister, the latter being an adult, sleep
together in the same bed.’ I have myself seen, a young man,
twenty years of age, sleeping in the same bed with his sister,
a young woman, sixteen or seventeen years old. That incestuous
intercourse takes place under these circumstances, there
is too much reason to believe; and that when unmarried young
men and women sleep together in the same room, the women
become common to the men, is stated as a positive fact; but I
regard another inevitable effect of this state of things as no
less pernicious; it is one of the instances which, for want of a
better term, may be called <i>unhumanizing</i>, because it tends to
weaken and destroy the feelings and affections which are distinctive
of the human being, and which raise him above the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
level of the brute. I have sometimes checked myself in the
wish, that men of high station and authority, would visit these
abodes of the less fortunate fellow-creatures, and witness with
their own eyes the scenes presented there; for I have thought
the same end might be answered in a way less disagreeable to
them. They have only to visit the Zoological Gardens, and
observe the state of society in that large room, which is appropriated
to a particular class of animals, where every want
is relieved, and every appetite and passion gratified, in full
view of the whole community. In the filthy and crowded
streets, in our large towns and cities, you see human faces retrograding,
sinking down to the level of those brute tribes; and
you find manners appropriate to the degradation. Can any
one wonder that there is among these classes of the people so
little intelligence&mdash;so slight an approach to humanity&mdash;so total
an absence of domestic affection, and of moral and religious
feeling? The experiment has been long tried on a large scale
with a dreadful success, affording the demonstration, that if,
from early infancy, you allow human beings to live like brutes,
you can degrade them down to their level, leaving to them
scarcely more intellect, and no feelings and affections proper
to human minds and hearts.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Dr. Lyon Playfair adduces instances of the crowding of
persons in the same room, without even the plea of necessity.
They are not, he informs us, the most extreme cases of the
kind.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>

<p>In Preston, out of 442 dwellings examined in unhealthy localities,
and inhabited at the time of the inquiry by 2400 persons
sleeping in 852 beds, it appeared that</p>

<p>“Amidst the dirt and disease of filthy back courts and
alleys, vices and crimes are lurking,” says the Rev. Mr. Clay,
“altogether unimagined by those who have never visited such
abodes.” The inspectors of prisons in Scotland, from separate
inquiries, have also come to the conclusion, that the physical
causes of disease, indirectly become the causes of crime.</p>

<p><i>Public Lodging Houses</i>, are another prolific source of disease
and vice. They are, in nearly all large cities, the nightly resorts
not only of the migrating laborer, and travelling artisan,
but, also, of the lower mendicants, thieves, and prostitutes.
These resorts are well known to the criminal police. In 1831,
Mr. James knew a house of this description in London, to contain
126 persons, many of them women and children, and perhaps
not more than a dozen beds in the place. At the census
of 1841, there were not more than 30 to 40 in any of these
houses; “still these numbers crowd the houses most annoyingly.”
It is no uncommon thing, as we learn from Dr. Duncan,
(<i>Report on the Sanatory State of Liverpool</i>,) for the keepers
of lodging houses to cover the floor with straw, and allow as
many human beings as can manage to pack themselves together,
to take up their quarters for the night, at the charge of
a penny each. The havoc made by the cholera in the lodging
houses at Manchester, in 1832, was terrible. In some of these
houses, as many as 6 or 8 beds were contained in a single room,
which are crowded promiscuously with men, women, and children.
Dr. Howard, after showing the lamentable extent to
which they become the hot-beds of <i>febrile</i> diseases of the most
violent and fatal character, owing mainly to their filthy and
unventilated condition, thus describes the morals of their frequenters,
and their malign influence in this way on the young
and inexperienced. “They serve as open receptacles of crime,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
vice, and profligacy, and as nurseries in which the young and
yet uninitiated, become familiar with every species of immorality.
They are the haunts of the most depraved and abandoned
characters, as well as the most miserable and suffering objects
of the town, (<i>Manchester</i>,) and constitute one of the most influential
causes of the physical and moral degradation of our
laboring population.”</p>

<p>Unless we are misinformed, the investigations now making
by the Board of Health of Philadelphia, will reveal a state of
things, not much behind, although on a smaller scale, those
described in the foregoing extracts; and as regards New York,
Dr. Griscom’s report, made a few years ago, exhibits a still
darker picture. With the warnings on the other side of the
Atlantic to deter us, we ought to have kept clear of these
nuisances entirely. Let us, as we have imitated the people of
Great Britain for evil, imitate them also for good, by instituting
the same searching inquiries into the nature and extent of these
physical and moral corruptions, that are recorded in the proceedings
of the various Parliamentary committees and Royal
Commissioners.</p>

<p>In Glasgow, the lodging houses have been subjected to
regular municipal supervision and ordinance, and, as we are
told, with excellent effects.</p>

<p>(1.) In their report the inspectors refer with natural interest
to the opening of the State Lunatic Asylum, which is expected to
be completed as early as January 1851. For want of it, “instances
have occurred in which the sheriff has been the medium
of a message from the judge who pronounced the sentence,
to the chief officer of the prison, informing him that the
prisoner was insane, but that no other mode of providing for
the case existed.”</p>

<p>The subject of pardons occupies a prominent place in their
report. It appears that but a fraction over six per cent. of the
pardoned have been recommitted; and the percentage of pardons
in relation to number, sex and color, cannot be so well
set forth in any other way as by transferring the table to our
pages.</p>

6 colored.</p>

<p>(2.) The warden’s report shows that of the 121 convicts received,
32 were foreigners, and 56 were natives of Pennsylvania.
Ninety-one were under middle age; 96 were of intemperate
habits; 76 could read and write; 60 were unmarried.
Only 14 were bound and served their time out; 13 were
bound and broke their indentures; and 96 were never bound.</p>

<p>Some curious facts appear in the various summaries which
these details embrace. For example, of the 2,421 prisoners
received into the institution from its opening in October 1829,
619 could neither read nor write; 2,020 were addicted to the
use of intoxicating drinks; 460, or more than one-sixth, were
foreigners; and of these last, Ireland supplied 199 and Germany
112. Seventeen hundred and twenty-nine were first convictions;
1,451 were never married; and 18 had been married
and separated; 1,631 were whites (48 females) and 790
colored (86 females); 467 broke their indentures, and 1,569
were never bound. Of the 2,421 crimes, 2,000 were against
property.</p>

<p>(3.) Next in order is the physician’s report, in which special
reference is made to the inordinate length of sentences, when
the nature of the discipline is duly considered. Dr. Given
thinks the coloured prisoners as a class, suffer a double burden,
inasmuch as their sentences are longer and the enervating influence
of imprisonment is more severely felt by them,&mdash;and
he furnishes the following items on this subject.</p>

<p>The Doctor is disposed to vindicate the exercise of the
pardoning power, even to a still greater extent than heretofore,
unless the need of its exercise is taken away by a proper
adjustment of the penal code to the penal discipline of the
State. We are not prepared to say how far it would be safe
to entrust the executive with power to remedy the errors or
supply the defects of the Legislature, but if it is given, its extent
should be clearly defined, and its exercise closely watched.
We do not make this remark with any reference to the past.
It is suggested by the idea, advanced in the report before us,
that the pardoning power must needs be freely exercised, to
compensate for the undue severity of the sentences. It is easy
to see where such a doctrine would lead if followed out. We
do not doubt the correctness of the statement, that the sentences
at present prescribed by our laws, are quite too long and too
indiscriminately inflicted, if we take into consideration the
nature and efficacy of the discipline under which they are to
be worked out; but in our haste to remedy the evil, we need
to be cautious, lest we incur another and even a greater, because
a more general and radical one. We hope this distinct
call of attention to the subject, will awaken our legislators to
early and efficient action. Where crying injustice is now
done under color of law, a double wrong is inflicted on society.
The agent and the instrument, become alike odious.</p>

<p>Dr. Given seconds the movement of the inspectors towards
some relief from the commitment of insane convicts. He
speaks of it not as a thing happening now and then, but as “<small>A
PRACTICE</small> to send thither as criminals, persons notoriously insane
or idiotic.” He also suggests the importance of some
more suitable provision than now exists, for those who may
become insane during their imprisonment.</p>

<p>Of the 15 deaths by disease, eleven were more or less diseased
on admission. The mortality for 1847 and 1848, gives a mean
of 4 per cent., which is the usual average. In respect to insanity,
Dr. Given’s researches show, that of the 121 commitments
during the year, 30 have had insane relatives;&mdash;10
cousins, 10 uncles or aunts, 5 parents, 4 mothers or sisters,
and 1 grandparents.</p>

<p>Ten cases of insanity are reported, 5 whites and 5 blacks,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
average age, 25. Four were in imperfect health when admitted;
one has an insane uncle, and two have an insane brother; 5
are stated as cases of dementia, and 5 as cases of monomania.</p>

<p>(4.) The moral instructor’s report informs us, that 288 sermons
have been preached in the prison, which is an average of
48 to each corridor, and nearly one service for every Sabbath
of the year. The whole number of visits recorded as having
been paid by this officer to the convicts, in the course of the
year, is 3,385.</p>

<p>II. The condition of the Western Penitentiary, is exceedingly
gratifying. The inspectors allude briefly to the animadversions
which have been made upon the Pennsylvania system;
but they express their confidence, that the happy results which
have attended its administration in that institution, will excite
in the public mind the same confidence in the advantages of
that system over all others, which long experience and personal
observation has excited in theirs.</p>

<p>The number of convicts received during the year 1848, (all
males,) was 55&mdash;discharged in the same time, 52. Of 1,286
prisoners received from the opening of the prison, July 1826,
only 22 have been white females; and only 215 colored convicts,
of whom 37 were females. Of the 115 in confinement
January 1, 1849, 88 were addicted to intemperance; 44 were
natives of Pennsylvania, and of the 55 received during the
year, 32 were unmarried. In respect to occupation, 42 of the
115 were laborers, 15 boatmen, 6 blacksmiths, 5 tailors. Of
the 55 received during the year, 38 were under middle age.</p>

<p>The physician’s report shows, that among 167 prisoners in
confinement during the year, only 4 deaths have occurred. Two
of the four were thoroughly diseased when admitted, a third
was of a consumptive family and died of consumption, and the
fourth was sixty-one years old, of intemperate habits and died
of apoplexy. A complete table is presented by the physician,
showing the color, sex, duration of imprisonment, and state of
health on reception and discharge of each prisoner, released
by expiration of sentence or by pardon, from which it appears,
that, <i>with one exception</i>, they were all received and discharged
in good health. Among these there were eleven, one or both
of whose parents died of consumption, two who were intemperate,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
and one very intemperate, and their average term of imprisonment
was eighteen months. Six were in better health
when discharged than when admitted, and one, who was partially
insane when admitted, was discharged in good health.</p>

<p>As a striking illustration of the healthfulness of the institution,
the physician states that between sixty and seventy
different convicts have been employed during the year in the
shoe department, and forty-eight or fifty on a daily average;
“of this number <i>only four have failed in consequence of indisposition,
to perform their full task of work. Throughout the year
every other than the four referred to have performed their regularly
allotted task.</i>” We are not surprised that the medical
officer thinks it proper to italicise a record of so remarkable a
measure of health.</p>

<p>From the moral instructor’s report, we extract a single, but
very sensible paragraph.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“It is not unfrequently the case that subjects which have
been presented in the ministrations of the Sabbath, are called
up by the prisoners themselves during the <i>daily visitation</i> in
their cells, and thus the opportunity is furnished of impressing
upon their minds, when alone, that <i>heavenly truth</i> which may
ultimately bring them to repentance and to God. In this feature
of the <i>separate system</i>, one of its principal excellencies consists.
The prisoner, by himself, separated from all vicious influences,
is far better prepared to receive and retain wholesome instruction
than when surrounded by men of a moral cast like his
own. If the reformation of convicts be accomplished at all,
it must be done, as a general rule, by those moral influences
which are made to reach him, <i>when</i> and <i>where</i> intercourse
with the vicious is cut off. In this situation he will listen, reflect
and reform.”</p></blockquote>

<p>III. The New Jersey Penitentiary, at Trenton, received 108
convicts during the year just past; and had 176 in confinement
December 31, 1848, which is 23 more than at the close of
1847. Of the 85 discharged during the year, 71 had completed
their sentences, twelve were pardoned, (two on the day
before their sentence expired,) and two died. Of 176 in confinement
at the date of the report, 99 were received in 1848,
and 38 in 1847. Eighty-six were for crimes against property,
142 for a first offence, 127 were under middle age and
42 were foreigners. In respect to color, 123 were whites,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
(114 males and 9 females,) and 53 were colored, (one a female.)
Sixty-six had no trade or occupation. The available means of
the prison, at the close of the year, were upwards of six thousand
dollars.</p>

<p>The physician’s report states, that “but <i>one</i> death occurred
during the year and that a suicide. From diseases contracted
within the prison, (where there are under discipline 260 persons,)
do not average one a year.” The physician says, that
“all experience has proved steam to be the best carrier of heat,
and by far the most certain and economical.”&mdash;p. 43.</p>

<p>The report of the Rev. Mr. Starr, (the moral instructor,) is
quite a valuable and intelligent document. We cannot refrain
from copying a single paragraph, touching the advantages of
separation as an element of prison discipline, especially in its
relations to moral and religious instruction.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The chances of amendment under the separate system,
duly sustained, must be incalculably greater than where companies
of men are congregated in their workshops. The plan is
severe; but, to use a paradoxical phrase, it is a <i>mild severity</i>.
The less abandoned are shut out from association with the
hardened, who may have spent years in familiarity with crime.
Each man has his books and his thoughts and his conscience
for companions. His keepers, his physician when in sickness,
his moral instructor, the superintendent of his daily labor, he
soon learns all are <i>his friends</i>. A great deal is in their power,
through the pleasant look, the friendly salutation, and the kind
interest manifested in those little alleviations which in no degree
interfere with the strictest and most wholesome discipline.
The prisoner’s self-respect will thus be encouraged and cultivated,
as he sees that he is not by all the world regarded in
the light of a hopeless outcast. He may be inspired with the
noble ambition of regaining his character, and leading in
future a reputable life. Such like benefits can be extended
with four-fold advantage in the separate plan of imprisonment,
while its solitude is relieved by the kind offices of a sympathizing
friendship.”</p></blockquote>

<p>IV. The inspectors of the Massachusetts State prison at
Charlestown, make a very favorable report of the health of
body and mind of the convicts under their care. “The favorite
system of congregate labor and lenient discipline, established
in our prison,” they say, “has fully answered the high
expectations of its most zealous advocates. Every year brings
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
with it new proofs of its practicability, and of its great superiority
over any and every other that differs from it.”</p>

<p>None will dissent, we presume, from the remark of the inspectors,
that “it should be remembered by all those who are
intrusted with the high prerogative of administering punishment,
that the convict in the prison is sentenced by the law to
expiate his crime by confinement and hard labor, and that
every degree of punishment beyond what is needful for the
due execution of this sentence, and the attainment of the best
ends to be answered by it, is excessive, is beyond the sentence
and intention of the law, and is without law or justice.”</p>

<p>The number of convicts received during the year ending
September 30, 1848, was 122; number discharged during the
year 129; remaining, 281. Of those discharged, 94 were by
expiration and 27 by remission of sentence, 2 were removed
to the lunatic asylum, 2 escaped, and 3 died. Of the 281 in
prison, 22 are negroes, and 8 mulattoes, 203 are below middle
age, and 228 are for crimes against property! Seventy-one are
foreigners, of whom 30 are from Ireland. Of the employments,
72 are stone-cutters, 20 blacksmiths, 69 cabinet-makers and
upholsterers, 21 brush makers, 9 “solitary prison-sweepers.”</p>

<p>The report of the warden concerning the twenty-seven who
were (during the year) pardoned, is very encouraging. “All
but one are doing well&mdash;are obtaining a livelihood by honest
labor, and are becoming respected citizens in the communities
where they reside.” Forty volumes have been purchased during
the year for the use of the prisoners, among which we
notice the Autobiography of Goethe, Bushnell’s Christian Nurture,
and Vestiges of Natural History.</p>

<p>The warden is of opinion that the lives of the three prisoners
who died was prolonged by their imprisonment, as they
had been long diseased!</p>

<p>The prison suffered a serious loss by fire during the year,
and from this and other causes the revenue of the institution is
less than the expenses by $4,242 79.</p>

<p>The physician’s report is a modest and sensible document,
evidently prepared with care. The sickness of the prison
would be represented by an average of four patients a day in
the hospital. Four hundred and twenty-five days of light
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
labor were prescribed during the year, and about the same
number of changes of labor. The general average of convicts
during the year was 287; and Dr. Bemis thinks his report
shows “a fair average degree of health fully equal to that of
the community at large, and vastly superior to what would
have been enjoyed by the same class of men in pursuit of their
usual modes of living when at large.”&mdash;p. 21.</p>

<p>The three deaths were of consumption.</p>

<p>The following remarkable statement from the physician’s report,
we cannot refrain from transferring to our pages.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The average period of imprisonment of all those sentenced
for life to the State Prison, since 1818, (amounting to 125,) has
not exceeded seven years. Nineteen of this number have
died in the Prison after an average confinement of seven
years.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The supply of a substantial suit of clothes and a sum of
money, not exceeding five dollars, to each discharged convict,
occasioned an expenditure last year of more than five hundred
dollars. In consequence of the frequent instances in which
the money thus furnished is spent indiscreetly, it has lately been
proposed in the Legislature to entrust the dispensation of this
bounty to the “Boston Society for the relief of discharged
convicts,” and a bill was introduced for that purpose. We
have not learned its fate. From a cotemporary print we
learn that, in consequence of the great increase in the number
of convicts at the Charlestown prison, it has become necessary
to use other accommodations than those which belong to the
prison proper.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> The chief cause assigned for this increase is
intemperance.</p>

<p><i>State Prison of Michigan.</i>&mdash;It is said that 128 convicts are
confined in the Michigan State Prison, and that the annual deficiency
in the receipts ranges from $5,000 to $10,000. The
Governor thinks that this sum is not more than a reasonable
profit upon convict-labor, considering what is made in other
State Penitentiaries within his knowledge!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>-</p>

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/hr.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="NO_1">No. 1.&mdash;<i>Institutions for the Insane.</i></h3>

<p>We have upon our table, the reports for the year 1848-9 of the Pennsylvania
Hospital for the Insane, (the eighth,) of the Massachusetts State
Lunatic Asylum, (the sixteenth,) of the New York State Lunatic Asylum,
(the sixth,) of the Physician and Superintendent of the M’Lean Asylum for
the Insane at Somerville, Massachusetts, (the thirty-first,) and of the New
Jersey State Lunatic Asylum, (the second.) The first and fourth are on
private, and the other three on a public foundation.</p>

<p>1. We suppose the first in our list combines as many of the substantial
advantages for the treatment of patients of this class, as any institution in
the world, and we are happy to know, that the prominent principles which
have been recognized in its structure and economy, have been adopted in
asylums of the latest date. The hospital has been quite full during the whole
year, and yet the health of the patients has been remarkably good. The present
arrangements are fitted to accommodate 200 patients, and provision will
soon be made for receiving 20 more. It is certainly desirable to extend the
benefits of such an institution to as large a number as can divide without
diminishing the aggregate of good, but we quite concur with Dr. Kirkbride
in the opinion, that a larger number than 220 could not be well received
in one building, nor receive due attention from one medical officer&mdash;“a
daily visit to all the wards, and a daily supervision of all the departments
by its official head, being exceedingly desirable in every institution for the
insane.” Seven of the seventeen deaths during the year, “occurred within
a fortnight after the patients’ admission,” and only one had been more than
a year in the asylum.</p>

<p>Of 1391 patients admitted to this hospital, 725 were under middle age,
(35 years,) and 666 over. Of 773 male patients, the leading occupations were
as follows:&mdash;farmers, 115; merchants, 66; laborers, 62; clerks, 50; carpenters,
30; shoemakers, 22; physicians, 19; seamen and watermen, 19;
teachers, 17; tailors, 15; students, 15; <small>NO OCCUPATION</small>, 108.</p>

<p>Of 618 females, 66 were seamstresses or mantua-makers, and 64 domestics;
store-keepers and attendants in stores, 12, and teachers, 9. Of single
females, not pursuing a regular employment, 29 were daughters of farmers,
and 29 daughters of merchants. Of the married, 57 were wives of farmers;
39 of laborers; 35 of merchants; 23 of clerks. Of the 618, 244 were single,
286 married and 88 widows. And of the 1391, 773 were natives of
Pennsylvania; 91 of New Jersey; 197 from other of the United States;
340 from foreign parts, of whom 189 were from Ireland!</p>

<p>The most productive cause of insanity, as shown by the returns, is intemperance,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
84; the next is mental anxiety, 69; grief for loss of friends, &amp;c.,
69; then comes the loss of property, 67; religious excitement, 56; domestic
difficulties, 45, and <i>unascertained</i>, 563! In 907 of the cases, insanity appeared
before middle age, leaving 384 only developed after that period.</p>

<p>The plan of detached cottages for a particular class of patients, continues
to be an approved feature of the arrangements; and among the valuable
improvements of the last year is the erection of a museum and reading-room
on an eligible site. The building is 46 feet by 24, with a piazza, and
the interior is furnished with interesting and valuable cabinets in natural
science, as well as with newspapers, maps, periodicals, pamphlets, &amp;c. On
the interesting topics of society, instruction, and moral treatment, and the
arrangements for heating and ventilation, much valuable information is furnished.
The annual receipts and expenses are balanced with the sum
of <i>twenty-six cents</i>, and the cost of each patient per week, including
every thing, is $3 88. The amount expended on <i>free patients</i> during the
year is $7,666 88. This is unalloyed charity.</p>

<p>2. The State Hospital at Worcester, (Massachusetts,) under the care of
Dr. Chandler, was overflowing with patients, though fifteen new rooms were
added during the year. The average number for the year was 404, and
the number of dormitories 360 only. The number of foreigners in the
hospital at the close of 1842 was 34, at the close of 1847 it was 121, and at
the close of 1848 it was 150!</p>

<p>Dr. Chandler is of opinion, that it would not be judicious to enlarge the
present hospital, but he would rather erect a new one, and separate the
sexes. He thinks three small hospitals, in different sections of the State,
would have some advantage over a large one.</p>

<p>The whole number of patients admitted from January 1833, to November
30, 1848, is 3084, of whom 1433 were discharged cured, 416 improved,
and 272 died. Of the patients admitted last year, 154 were under
middle age, and 255 above, showing a very different result from that which
we have stated above at the Pennsylvania hospital. Of the whole number
received at Worcester, the cause of insanity in 322 cases is supposed to have
been intemperance; in 266 domestic affliction; in 233 religious views, and
in 161 self-abuse. Hereditary tendencies to insanity were traced in 691
cases. Fifteen hundred and sixty-one were single, one thousand two
hundred and thirty-two married, one hundred and ninety-nine widows,
and eighty-six widowers. Dr. C. thinks it very clear that the sympathies
and motives to action, which the domestic relations supply, are all but indispensable
to keep the whole system of mind and body in a healthful state.
If we understand the report of the trustees, the cost to the State of each
patient is $2 33⅓.</p>

<p>3. The report of the New York State Lunatic Asylum established at
Utica, was made to the Legislature, February 1, 1849. During the six years
since it was opened, it has had an annual average of 335 patients. The
whole number under care during 1848, was 877, of whom 495 were removed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
at the end of the year. Judges of county courts have authority to send
to the asylum any person who becomes insane and whose estate is insufficient
for the support of himself and family; and the county is chargeable with the
expenses of his restoration, if it is effected within the space of two years.
Six hundred and twenty-nine of this class have been received into the institution
since it was opened, and have thus been partakers of the most
seasonable and appropriate charity which the public can bestow. These
have been among the most hopeful subjects of hospital treatment, and
would have suffered most for want of it.</p>

<p>The hospital is lighted by 280 burners from gas manufactured on the
premises. The expense of work, fixtures, &amp;c., was $5,346 48,&mdash;and this
mode of lighting, is regarded not only as safer and more secure and pleasant,
but as cheaper than the former mode. The price of board and hospital care,
to patients who are chargeable to towns or counties, is $2 per week. Pay
patients are charged from $2 50 to $4 per week, according to the accommodations
they receive. The receipts of the year fully meet the current
expenses.</p>

<p>Of 382 discharges during the year, 189 were men and 193 were women;
174 were cured, (viz., 87 men and 87 women,) and 84 were improved.
There were 86 deaths. Some salutary cautions are given respecting the
removal of distant patients to the hospital, especially in sudden and acute cases
of insanity, and where they are in a weak or diseased state, and exposed to
much suffering and fatigue on the journey. The opinion of a judicious
physician should be taken before the attempt to remove them is made.
Other and equally important cautions are given against delaying to
send such as are clearly deranged, merely because they are monomaniacs,
or not violent, nor very excitable. “Those cases of insanity that are most
improperly and most frequently neglected and kept at home until they are
incurable, are unattended by much excitement; those that come on very
gradually, unperceived for a long time, excepting by the most intimate acquaintances,”
(p. 20.)</p>

<p>Of the whole number, (2,014,) 1017 were men, and 997 women; 1213
became insane before middle life, and 801 after that period. Of the 1017
men, 437 were farmers and 133 laborers, 57 merchants and 51 scholars; and
of the 997 women, 853 were employed at house-work, or were without any
special trade or employment; 45 were school girls; 30 tailoresses; 24 instructresses;
21 milliners; 16 mantua-makers; 7 factory-girls; and 1 music-teacher.
As to their civil condition, 957 were single; 937 married; 83
widows; and 39 widowers. 1417 were natives of New York, and 300 were
from foreign lands.</p>

<p>Among the causes of insanity, are religious anxiety 178, loss of property
86, sickness and death of kindred 74, excessive study 51, intemperance 67,
Millerism 36, disappointed in love 53, abuse by husband 28, blows on the
head 24, fright 24, excessive labor 33, anxiety about absent friends, 18.
Among the amusements of the patients, debates, tableaux, singing and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
dancing, and theatrical performances. Of the whole number, (2014,) 251,
(108 men and 143 women,) were disposed to suicide. This variety of insanity
is by no means the most incurable. On the contrary, some of the
most permanent and complete recoveries, are from this form of disease.
From a register kept by Dr. Bingham for four years at this hospital, of all
the suicides occurring in the State of New York, and noticed in the public
prints, it appears that 74 cases occurred in 1845, 64 in 1846, 106 in 1847,
and 88 in 1848.</p>

<p>In relation to hereditary insanity, the report shows that of the 2014 patients
received at the institution, 637 are known to have insane relatives,
and 273 are known to have had insane parents, or nearly 1 in 7. Dr. Brigham
expresses the opinion that <i>all other causes combined have not so much
influence in producing insanity, as the transmission of the disease from
parents to their offspring</i>, p. 36. In other words, that the exciting causes
would be inadequate to produce insanity, but for the inherent constitutional
tendency to it. Dr. B also declares his belief, that there is more insanity
in this country than in any other, especially in the northern and eastern
States, and <i>that it is fearfully on the increase</i>, p. 38.</p>

<p>Some valuable suggestions respecting the prevalent causes of insanity and
the means of obviating them, are thrown out, and are entitled to the earnest
and studious regard of parents and teachers, as well as of professional
circles.</p>

<p>4. In the <i>M’Lean Asylum</i> there were received during the year 1848,
153 patients, (71 males and 72 females.) Dismissed, 155, (87 males, 68
females,) of whom 82 were restored, (55 males, and 37 females.) There
were 23 deaths during the year. The total number of patients received
from 1837, is 1696. The average of the first six years of this term was
115, and the average of the second six years, was 166. Of the whole number,
884 were discharged as cured, and 184 died. The report enters at
much length into a history of the construction of the buildings, and of the
recent alterations, amounting almost to a reconstruction of the largest and
most modern building on the male side.</p>

<p>In conjunction with these alterations, a new heating and ventilating
apparatus has been introduced, and as we know the very great solicitude
that is felt in respect to this point by those who are commissioned to devise
the plan and oversee the construction of such edifices, we extract so much
of the report as relates to it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Every room has a hot air and a foul air flue opening in it, the entrance
being protected by an ornamental grate, and the galleries have five or six
flues of each kind opening in them, in order that the diffusion may be
general. The flues are twelve by twelve, and twelve by nine inches in
size.</p>

<p>“The pure supplies of air are received into a large reservoir or space in
the basement between the walls forming the sides of the galleries above, and
in which both kinds of flues are built. This main air channel has an area
of at least fifteen feet, and terminates externally in a low tower, fully exposed
to the passing air.</p>

<p>“The heater is a vertical boiler on the tubular plan, about eight feet in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
height and thirty inches in diameter. The fuel (anthracite) is placed within
the boiler, and that is so placed within the reservoir before named, that
only a small part of it, required to receive the fuel, is left outside.</p>

<p>“On each side of the reservoir of air, is a construction consisting of six
longitudinal chambers one above the other, the whole length of it. The
lower three, separated from the upper three by a brick arch and from each
other by partitions of wood, are the ventilating channels receiving at intervals
the flues from above and finally terminating beneath the exhausting
shaft, to be described.</p>

<p>“The upper range consists of the three channels for hot air. Both of these
ranges are so arranged that a channel answers to a story above, and thus
each story of the house has its heating and ventilation entirely independent
of any other.</p>

<p>“Each hot air channel has a pair of four inch cast iron water pipes connected
with spigot joints and iron cement; one end of each comes off the
boiler near the top, and the other or return end, enters the boiler on the
other side, near its bottom. The hot and cold ends of each pair of pipes
are on opposite sides, in order that the average heat at any place where the
air is delivered above may be the same. The three pair of pipes receive
and return their water, through tubes reduced to two inches diameter, as
recommended by Mr. Hood, the highest authority on this class of subjects,
and at the same level. The degree of curvature essential in this form of
connection, was expected to make a difference in the velocity of the circulating
fluid, and consequent temperature at which the water would be found
in the different ranges. Practically no material difference is remarked.
The radiating pipes cross at the bottom of the cold air reservoir. The air
flows in to impinge upon them through arched spaces left in the front of
the channels, looking towards the reservoir. Every flue for hot or foul air
is commanded by a slide readily approached below.</p>

<p>“The heated air is always admitted near the ceiling to obviate any contamination
at its point of delivery. The foul air is drawn off near the
wash-board, any impurities there deposited being drawn down, but not into
the room. The diffusion of the air, where an adequate exhaustive power
is provided, is also much favored by being thus turned in its course, and
the lower stratum is not uncomfortably cool to the feet,&mdash;a common objection
to the usual method of receiving and withdrawing the supplies.</p>

<p>“The foul air channels into which the flues from each story open, do not
come together, until just as they pass under the foot of the ventilating shaft
or chimney, which through the agency of a cast iron pipe, a foot in diameter
in the middle of the shaft, running up fifty feet and receiving the smoke
from the furnaces, constitutes the moving power. This shaft is built of brick
in a useless angle where the two buildings approached each other, and has
an internal diameter, it being a circle, of about six feet at its basis a few
feet below the cellar floor, and terminates in one of the original chimney
stacks at the corner of the foundation of the dome, height of about seventy-five
feet, and with about one half its size at bottom. A deviation of a few
feet from the perpendicular was inevitable at about two-thirds its length.
It is carefully plastered or <i>pargetted</i> within. As its upper opening was
commanded by the spherical dome, endangering the regurgitation of wind
at certain times, it was surmounted with a form of chimney-cap, figured in
Mr. Tredgold’s works some forty years since, and being essentially that recently
introduced into considerable use in this vicinity.</p>

<p>“As a cure for smoky chimneys, this cap has considerable efficiency, but
is regarded as of very trifling moment as for as suction or exhaustion from
below is required. For its power is too feeble at all times, for such an
amount of ventilation as an insane hospital requires, and depends wholly on
the fluctuation currents of external air. If the upper range of bricks had
been laid with a bevel upwards, and a plain plate of metal placed on four
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
short legs a few inches above, it would have answered equally well and at
a tenth of the cost. The rarefaction produced by the heat radiated from
the central iron smoke pipe occasions a partial vacuum, instantly filled from
the rooms behind.</p>

<p>“The whole length of cast iron hot water pipe is about 600 feet, and with
the portion of the heater within the main air cell or reservoir, and the
smaller wrought iron tubes connecting the extremes of each of the six
pipes with the upper and lower ends of the boiler, constitutes a radiating
surface of over 700 square feet. The effective fire surface of the boiler is
probably about 30 superficial feet, and about 60,000 cubic feet of space
above in the three corridors, and the rooms opening upon them, are to be
heated.</p>

<p>“The amount of anthracite consumed in the twenty-four hours of our
coldest weather, is not far from 400 lbs.; the water in the extremities of the
pipes receiving it from the heater, rarely exceeds 180° F. and falls off about
20° at its point of re-entering.</p>

<p>“All these expressions, however, are quite indefinite without taking into
consideration the extent of change required in the air. It is obvious that
by closing the damper which commands the ventilating shaft, the relations
of temperature of the air, and of the pipes would at once sympathize. With
the active power of the shaft, it is certain that any possible amount of ventilation
may be attained. Indeed, it is probable that the present shaft is
equal to the demands of the remainder of the male wing in addition. The
escape of the steam pump is injected into the centre of the ventilating
space, giving us, for some hours daily, the aid of this recently adopted and
exceedingly efficient means of ventilation.</p>

<p>“While a sufficient time has not yet elapsed to stamp our apparatus with
the seal of experience, the only test of such appliances in the mechanical
arts, yet we are authorized to declare that, as far it has been tried, it promises
all that could be desired in supplying a full, certain, and manageable
amount of air, in its highest hygienic conditions.</p>

<p>“The cost of getting up a complete system of hot-water warming and
exhaustive ventilation in a country where few examples or approximate
specimens are to be found&mdash;in a climate which nullifies all European experience&mdash;where
all parties, suggesters and mechanics, are obliged to acquire
a certain experience as they go along, must be much greater than when
this subject shall be well understood and generally adopted, as it eventually
cannot fail to be. Independent of making the flues and ventilating chimney,
items which in new undertakings would naturally come under the
head of construction account, the expense of our undertaking will fall considerably
below a thousand dollars, and we are satisfied that with the experience
acquired in this single trial, it could be gone over again at a very considerable
reduction of cost.”</p></blockquote>

<p>We have left ourselves but a finger’s breadth of room for a notice of the report
of the <i>N. Jersey State Lunatic Asylum</i> at Trenton, rendered December 1848.
It is accompanied by a view and ground plan of the buildings, which were
opened for patients on the 15th of May last, under the superintendence of
Dr. H.&nbsp;A. Buttolph. They are designed for the accommodation of 200 patients,
and in their general structure and arrangement accord with those of the
Pennsylvania Hospital already noticed. The asylum occupies a most eligible
site, about two miles north-west of the public buildings, surrounded by a choice
farm of 111 acres, with an unfailing supply of fine soft water, and a beautiful
grove in the rear, thus affording abundant room for hospital purposes, and embracing
every variety of scenery and spacious pleasure grounds for the use of
the patients. The various fixtures for warming, ventilating and lighting, as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
well as the arrangements for cooking, washing, bathing, &amp;c., are after the
most improved models, and are described with interesting and intelligible
minuteness in the report, an examination of which we would recommend to
all who are seeking information on the subject. The number received
during the year was 86, of whom 83 remained in the asylum at the date of
the report. A large proportion of the number received were chronic cases,
which are generally very numerous at the opening of such institutions. Of the
86, 27 were under middle age; 52 were single and 30 married. Of their
occupations, 22 of the men were farmers, and 16 of the women were house-keepers.
An hereditary tendency to insanity was traced in 18 of the 86
cases, or about as 1 to 5.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Virginia.</span>&mdash;The Eastern Insane Asylum of Virginia is established at
Williamsburg, and the Western at Staunton. At the former were received
in 1848, 34 patients, 15 males and 19 females. The number under care,
October 1, 1848, was 165. Aggregate of inmates during the year 198; discharged
6 males and 10 females; deaths 17, (8 males and 9 females.)
Spacious additions to the buildings are now in progress, a portion of which
will be appropriated to colored patients. The receipts of the year were
$41,350 64, and the expenditures $29,716 89.</p>

<p>At the latter institution were received during the year ending October 1,
1848, 70, (39 males and 31 females,) making an aggregate of 277 under care
during the year. There were discharged in the same time 50 patients, of
whom 40 were recovered, (21 males and 19 females,) and 7 more or less
improved; 2 were unimproved, 1 eloped, and 22 died.</p>

<p>Among the causes assigned for insanity, we notice hard study is given
in the case of 11 males and 1 female, intemperance 16 males, and domestic
affliction 6 males and 18 females. Seven thousand dollars have been expended
lately in new buildings.

<h3 id="NO_2">No. 2.&mdash;<i>The precise present character of transportation
explained, with suggestions by Ignotus.</i></h3>

<p>We observe in our English papers a brief notice of a pamphlet of fifty
pages, published in London a short time since, advocating some important
modifications of the transportation system. As we regard the system itself
too near extinction to render any modifications of it particularly valuable or
interesting, we notice the publication only for the sake of what the author
says about <i>convict-separation</i>. We take, by piece-meal, the whole extract
of the English reviewer, venturing a brief comment on some passages.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“This sort of confinement (separation) has, of late years, been extravagantly
commended by some, and as loudly reprobated by others. The truth
seems to lie between the two extreme opinions. (A position which truth has
long been supposed to occupy.) We are led, by our own observations, to
value it but little as an <i>active agency</i> for reforming criminals, but to allow
it a high place as auxiliary, in general, to that which is reformatory in the
highest degree, <i>Christian instruction in the hands of Christian men</i>.”</p></blockquote>

<p>We are not aware of any system of prison discipline that possesses or
pretends to possess an “active agency for reforming criminals,” independent
of Christian instruction. We imprison men to punish them, and we
think the “<i>active agency</i>” of punishment is quickened by separation.
And hence we hold, that apart from reformatory influences, separation during
imprisonment is preferable to association, considered merely as a punishment.
When, however, we introduce the agency which is “reformatory
in the highest degree,” (to wit, “<i>Christian instruction in the hands of
Christian men</i>,”) the comparative fitness of the two modes of imprisonment
to receive and employ it, is at once revealed, and, as “Ignotus” says,
the separation of the convicts is then seen to occupy a high place as an
auxiliary to its influence.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The separate system is free, certainly, from many things which impede
the reformation of criminals; from the perpetual distrust and perpetual
punishment which are necessary to enforce <i>silence</i> in <i>association</i>, and from
the grosser vices of the older style of prisons, mutual contamination and
hardening in villany. It allows a return to feelings of self-respect. It removes
all possibility of combination for evil purposes, and prevents the exertion
of that fascinating influence which the practised villain exerts so
destructively over the novice in crime. It protects the penitent, in his first
desires and efforts to return to God. It is something, also, as regards others
less hopeful, even for a time, effectually to break the chain of their evil
habits, and to compel the mind, however reluctant, to turn inwards and
reflect, until the dormant powers of conscience be aroused. Beyond this it
does not seem to go in producing amendment; and we are persuaded, that
if the benign and saving influence of our divine religion were withdrawn
from a prison on the separate plan, not a single inmate would ever leave
its walls a whit more reformed than from any other.”</p></blockquote>

<p>We think the friends of separation could scarcely ask for a more favorable
exhibit of its advantages than <i>Ignotus</i> gives. It certainly places that
system far in advance of any and all others as the basis of reformation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
And while we readily admit that it is but a basis, and that higher and better
influences must be relied on to make it efficient as a means of reformation,
we cannot agree with the author, that convicts from a separate prison are
not likely to leave its walls a whit more reformed than convicts from Newgate
or from Blackwell’s Island. To keep bad men apart must always,
under all circumstances, be more conducive to their reform, than to suffer
their intercommunication. If “the benign and saving influence of our divine
religion,” were withdrawn from the city of London or New York, it would
become a pandemonium; but no one would say, that if each man, woman and
child, were separated from every other man, woman and child by an impassable
gulf, the degree of corruption would not be essentially reduced.
Close association breeds the plague of cities&mdash;comparative separation keeps
the country clean and wholesome. The analogies of the moral and natural
world are very obvious in this respect.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“If it be thought, from what has been written of late years on the subject,
that a greater efficacy should be attributed to separate confinement,
let it be borne in mind, that cotemporaneously with its adoption in any
prison, there has been very much greater care taken than ever used to be
in the selection of officers to superintend the discipline, and to convey moral
and religious instruction to the prisoners. Wherever Christianity has been
brought to bear upon criminals, in its real power and blessedness, good has
been accomplished under the most untoward circumstances; sinners have
been brought to Christ and salvation; and the mass, if not converted unto
God, have been marvellously civilized. This was manifested by the success
which followed the self-denying labors of Mrs. Fry, and other pious persons
in Newgate; of that eminent man Dr. Browning, in so many convict ships;
of Sir Edward Parry, who labored like a missionary amongst his <i>assigned</i>
convict servants, at Port Stephen’s; of Colonel Demaresq, also acting in the
same spirit, under the same circumstances, at St. Helier’s and St. Aubyn’s;
and of Sarah Martin, in the gaol of Yarmouth, of whose unwearied and
blessed labors the Government Inspector, Captain Williams, makes such
honorable mention in several reports. The superior mind of a person invested
with authority, may exercise a most salutary influence upon any class
of human beings, but Christian doctrine, and Christian character <i>consistent
enough to stand the scrutiny of the bad</i>, accomplish greater things; and
the lower any are sunken, the more commanding is this influence upon
their minds.”</p></blockquote>

<p>We presume the prevailing sentiments of this passage, will meet a hearty
response from all our readers. We are in no danger of attributing too
much efficacy to the power of the truth over the mind when it has access
to it. It may be questioned, however, whether its influence is not greatly
hindered, and sometimes completely obstructed, by the debasing vices of
convicts. We are not quite prepared to admit, that the lower the human
mind sinks, the more commanding is the influence upon it of Christian doctrine
and Christian character, though we would regard no case as beyond
the reach of such an influence.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The <i>combination</i> of pious Christian zeal with good judgment and a
knowledge of human nature, in the head of any prison establishment, we are
convinced is more likely to lead to the reformation of its inmates, than any
<i>system</i> of discipline <i>without it</i>. It has the blessing of God, “without whom
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
nothing is strong, nothing is holy, nothing is perfect.” But, whatever may
be thought of the influence of separate confinement, as <i>a means of reformation</i>,
there should be no doubt about its utility as a punishment, if not carried
to an extreme. It is a most severe one, certainly; but this is not without
great advantages, even in an economical point of view; for in proportion as
it is severe, the sentence may be abridged, and its heaviest pressure is upon
those who deserve it most. Criminals, of all men, can least bear to be alone.
A thoroughly bad man, by himself, is the greatest coward, and without his
accustomed stimulants, the most wretched of beings; we have no hesitation,
therefore, in stating, that such a man would prefer even the scanty
food, the vermin and the sloth of such a place as Newgate, where he might
gamble for his supper, learn new tricks or instruct the novice, sing, play,
and quarrel by turns in the night-room, than the very best treatment and the
most abundant diet of a prison on the new plan. The <i>reformatory character</i>
of such a gaol is, to such persons, an object of real terror. A visiting justice
of the gaol of Reading, stated before Lord Brougham’s Committee (p. 478-9,)
that full 50 per cent of the vagrant class had actually fled out of Berkshire,
lest they might be immured in so horrible a place. It is however, an expensive
plan for the treatment of criminals; its <i>individuality</i> and severe
pressure creating a necessity for better occupation of the mind and body,
a more liberal diet and a greater number of teachers than where prisoners
are associated.”</p></blockquote>

<p>We regard the features of separation which Ignotus delineates in the
foregoing passage, as most highly commendatory of it as a means of discipline
and reform. This better occupation of the mind and body, a more liberal
diet, and the greater number of teachers, which become so needful, indicate just
what the desire for wholesome food does in a convalescent patient. His
vices had made wholesome occupation of either mind or body irksome; and
the attempt to teach him good knowledge was to annoy, if not to offend him.
If separation from the haunts and fellowship of the wicked makes him long
for what he once loathed, the public are “penny-wise and pound-foolish,”
if they grudge the supply. It is the token of returning health and should
be hailed with joy and gratitude.</p>

before the Courts, 46 were news-boys. During the year 1847, out of
112 minors, 58 were news-boys.</p>

<p>“During the year 1847, out of 30 licensed, six were brought in for larceny
during one week.</p>

<p>“There is evidently a great increase of crime among minors. The
Police books show that the number arrested and brought in, is more than
one hundred each quarter.</p>

<p>“The following extract is from the City School Report for the year 1847.</p>

<p>“‘Does the instruction provided by the City reach all those persons for
whom it is intended? This question suggests itself to every one who observes
the apparently great number of children, at large, in school hours,
in almost every part of the City.</p>

<p>“‘It is not difficult to find out what are the occupations of many of these
children. They are hawkers of papers, or sellers of matches,&mdash;most of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
time occupied in quarreling and gambling. They are beggars, male and
female, strolling from street to street, through lanes, by-ways and alleys,
practicing the elementary lessons of pilfering, lying, deception and theft.
They may be seen wherever wooden structures are in the process of building,
repairing, or tearing down;&mdash;seeking for fragments of wood to which
they evidently feel they have a very questionable right. They are the
loafers on wharves and in all the modes of juvenile vice. Are these children
in the way to become useful citizens or happy and respectable men?
Are they not growing up to be the occupants of jails and almshouses? Are
they not in a course of education for worthlessness and crime?</p>

<p>“‘Let us see what answer the records of the courts of justice make to
these questions.</p>

<p>“‘There are, on an average, 74 inmates of the House of Reformation;
nearly the same number in the school on Thompson’s Island; and, for the
year ending in November last, 456, under age, had been inmates of the
jails.</p>

<p>“‘In reference to providing instruction for this great mass of uneducated
children, our <i>system</i> is not defective. Sufficient provision is now made for
the instruction of those children who have passed the age at which they are
admissible into the primary schools, and who are not qualified for the grammar
schools. The number of this class is rapidly increasing, and is likely
to increase still more. Our system was contrived and adapted to a small
city, peopled by persons born in New England, and always enjoying and
disposed to avail themselves of the advantages of the free-school system of
these States. But some (no?) provision has been made for the vast accessions
to our population by immigration from foreign countries of persons of
every age, and of every condition of ignorance. Our system of government
supposes educated citizens; and will not be safe unless our citizens
are more or less educated. Now there are great masses coming in upon us
who are not educated, except to vice and crime; the creatures or the victims
of the justice or the oppression, or the over-population of the old world.
For the education of these, adult and juvenile, not only must provision be
made, but means must be used to render the provision effective. It is not
enough to say that provision is made for their education, if they will avail
themselves of it at a proper time. Unless they are made inmates of our
schools, many of them will become inmates of our prisons; and it is vastly
more economical to educate them in the former than to support them in the
latter. The annual cost of educating an individual at the public schools is
from six to twenty dollars. The annual cost of the support of an individual
in the House of Reformation, the cheapest of all such institutions, is forty-four
dollars, and in the House of Correction probably not less than one hundred
dollars; and in this estimate is not included the great expense of the
administration of criminal law, much of which might be prevented by the
proper education of these children.</p>

<p>“‘It is a defect in the organization of this (School) Board, that there is
now no person connected with and acting under direction of the Board, to
ascertain what children of the legal age are not in the schools, and to use
measures to bring them there. This Board is the only one which has, officially,
a knowledge of the numbers of children in the schools and of those
who ought to be there. It is the one whose duty it is to provide means for
the education of all the children. It would be well if it could have authority
not only to use means to bring wandering children into the schools,
but to provide for the instruction of those portions of the adult population
who are without, and who desire elementary instruction,&mdash;that is, instruction
in reading, writing and accounts.’</p>

<p>“I know of no one thing,” says the City Marshal, “that is so much
needed as a proper home for idle and vagrant <i>female</i> children, the ascertained
number of which class is 184. There are, undoubtedly, 300 of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
same character now in the City, they may be seen at the entrance of every
public building and every great thoroughfare, peddling small articles or begging,
and insulting every person who refuses to buy, or give when asked.
Many of them have been so long neglected, that they are familiar with
crime in its worst forms, but against whom it is difficult to procure evidence,
and when procured, the only place they can be sent to, is to the House of
Correction or House of Industry for short terms, and then they are suffered
to go at large without a proper home or friends to care for them.</p>

<p>“In regard to habitual truants from the schools, I am satisfied that the
powers of the Courts, and the City authorities, are entirely <i>inadequate</i> to
meet the evil. The late Mayor directed me to detail some officer whose
whole duty it should be to look after the truants that were reported to
him, by the masters of the several schools.</p>

<p>“From the report of the officer detailed for this purpose, I make the following
extract:</p>

<p>“‘During the year that I have had the charge of Truants, I have been
called upon by the teachers of the Grammar and other Schools, to nearly
300 truant and idle children; and for want of some system by which to be
governed, my practice has been as far as possible adapted to the circumstances
of the case. I first call upon the parents, find out their condition
and the character of the boy complained of, in order to know how to proceed
with him; admonish him, and always in the first instance take him
back to the school to which he belongs. In many cases this course has
been sufficient. If called again to the same boy, by the consent of the parents,
I have locked him up for a few hours, and given him to understand
that a complaint against him would remain on file to be proceeded with if
he again offends. This, sometimes, has been enough, but not often. After
taking a boy to School two or three times, and he finds that nothing further
is done, the Police-man’s badge and staff have no terrors for him. The
reason, I think, is this. The law does not reach his case&mdash;the Courts say
he is not a vagrant, because he has a home&mdash;and he is not a stubborn and
disobedient child within the meaning of the statute. He is disobedient only
so far as he is a truant; and there is no law against truancy. I have been
into Court with a number of such cases and did not succeed in sustaining
the complaint. The decision was almost fatal to the boy, and a great injury
to the School to which he belonged. The only course left for us after
this, was to watch the boy until we could arrest him for some trifling offence
<i>known to the law</i>, and have him punished, which seemed to be necessary
for the good of the boy, as well as the School.’</p>

<p>“The above statistics have been obtained in the following manner.
During <i>school hours</i> the officer has visited the wharves, public thoroughfares,
and all other places where these children congregate, and by kind
treatment and persuasion, learned their names and residence, then gone with
them to their homes and ascertained their condition, and that of their parents,
a record of which is now in this office, and to which additions are daily
made.”</p></blockquote>

<p>This brief history of juvenile vagrancy in the city of Boston, whose
school system has been so long and justly regarded as her chief glory, will
not surprise those who are familiar with scenes at the wharves, railway-stations
and steamboat landings of New York, Philadelphia and Baltimore.
Innumerable specimens of the same class of young renegades may be seen
also at the doors or in the vestibules of public houses in the large inland
towns; and unless some mild compulsory process is devised to form them
to better habits, it is certain that a severe one will be demanded to protect
the community against their violence and depredations.

<h3 id="NO_4">No. 4.&mdash;<i>The London Christian Observer’s notice of Rev. Mr.
Field’s work on the advantages of the separate system of imprisonment.</i></h3>

<p>In our last number we inserted, entire, an article on Mr. Field’s work,
from the “London Medical and Chirurgical Review.” The February (1849)
number of the <i>London Christian Observer</i> devotes ten or fifteen pages to
it, and inclines “to agree to a considerable extent in the author’s opinion,
that the separate system is superior, not only to every other system that has
hitherto been tried, but also to any that shall be, or can be hereafter devised.”
This is rather more than we should be willing to say of any human device,
but we are glad to see an English periodical of so much influence and reputation
committing itself so heartily to the right side.</p>

<p>The “Observer” has strangely fallen into the notion, that absolute solitude
without labor or instruction, was ever adopted <i>as a system of discipline
in the United States</i>. He speaks of “our good friends in the United States,”
as having run into the extreme of “entire solitude for six or ten months
together in prisons of the most wretched description,” but when the effects
were seen, “the system was abandoned at once.” He expresses thankfulness,
that this dreadful system was never tried in England, but that they have
been permitted to learn better by the experience of their neighbors. There
is no doubt, that studious efforts have been made by the opponents of separation
in our country to confound it with solitude, and to give the impression,
that whatever evils are imagined or proved to result from the latter, are
necessarily incident to the former. But we should have looked for a little
more discrimination in the Observer, and for evidence of more thorough
knowledge on a subject of so much interest. Indeed, we might almost suppose,
that the needful supply of knowledge and discrimination is at hand,
when the inquiry affects the good repute of the “sea girt isle,” and only
fails when the institutions of “young America” are presented for review.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“We come now,” says the Observer, “to the separate system as we have
it <i>amongst ourselves</i>, and we must request our readers to bear in mind, that
this system is essentially different from the <i>Solitary</i>, properly so called&mdash;different
in its objects, in its working, in its effects. The separate cell is
but the sick room, in which the morally diseased is put under treatment for
such time as his case requires. The solitary cell is (or rather was, for it no
longer exists among civilized nations) the grave; where the patient is left
as being past treatment and without hope of recovery. Yet the two methods
have been, and are confounded, and the failure of the one, with all its attendant
circumstances of horror, is used blindly or unscrupulously as an argument
against the other.”&mdash;p. 129-30.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is this “blind or unscrupulous” confounding of solitude and its effects,
with separation and its fruits, that constitutes one of the crying sins against
humanity, for which we think the anti-separatists will be called to account.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“We are sorry that we cannot follow Mr. Field through his description
of the system of instruction, and its effects on the prisoners in general. His
work abounds in examples of the ignorant instructed, the profligate reclaimed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
the hardened convict subdued, the weak-minded set firm in good principles;
and almost all thankful for the discipline they have undergone, and
setting out afresh in this world of trials, with, at all events, new strength
and better principles. Mrs. Fry, indeed, regarding man as adapted for a
state of trial, argued against the system<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> as one that takes the convict away
from trial altogether; but surely, there are stages and states in the moral
life, when the discipline of solitude and reflexion is absolutely required;
just as the body, though its intended sphere of action may be the air and the
light, may absolutely require total seclusion from both, must be placed in
bed, and take sharp medicines, instead of taking exercise and facing the
weather. To say nothing of the fact, that a crowded prison-yard can scarcely
be regarded as a <i>fair</i> field of probation for any man.</p>

<p>“Altogether, we regard the present state of things with respect to this
whole subject as affording a ground of great encouragement and thankfulness
to God; and as opening prospects of large social improvement both at
home and in the Colonies; for the wretched system of transportation, the
plan of peopling new lands with the outcasts of the old, seems to have received
its deathblow from the introduction of wholesome discipline at home.
There are a few minor differences to be adjusted regarding the treatment
of convicts, the length of their separate confinement, and the mode of disposing
of them for the rest of their sentence; but the principle is now fairly
admitted, that the prison is to be a place of severe moral and religious discipline.
The office of a gaol chaplain, instead of being the most loathsome
and repulsive that a clergyman could hold, is now a work full of interest and
promise and hope, bringing often a speedy return for labor. Sarah Martin,
the pious needlewoman of Yarmouth, who passed her life among the wretched
inhabitants of the gaol, would indeed have rejoiced, if she could have
accompanied as we have done, the zealous Chaplain of one of these new
gaols along the clean, light, well-aired corridor, and entered with him into
one cell after another, where the prisoner welcomed him cheerfully and respectfully,
repeating his few verses of psalm or hymn&mdash;a voluntary task&mdash;and
listened thankfully for the kind admonition or encouragement of perhaps
the first friend he ever knew. It seems as if God had raised up men
on purpose for the work. We are personally acquainted with some Gaol
Chaplains, and have read the Reports of many, and believe, in most cases
they are men of energy, discernment and piety. If we have a fault to find
with them, it is, that from their experience of visible effects speedily and
uniformly produced on those who are under their charge, they come to
speak and write as if the reformation of a sinner were a matter of certainty,
provided only a sufficient time is allowed. We are aware, that this is only
an apparent error, for no man would be more ready than Mr. Field to acknowledge
the absolute necessity of the power of the Holy Spirit in any
work of genuine reformation.”</p></blockquote>

<h3 id="NO_5">No. 5.&mdash;<i>Kentucky State Penitentiary.</i></h3>

<p>A friend has kindly forwarded to us a copy of the annual report of the
keeper, clerk, &amp;c., of the Kentucky Penitentiary, for the year 1848. It is
located at Frankfort, and as the reports indicate, is administered with much
success. We have noted a few items of general interest.</p>

<p>It was formerly the custom to <i>shave the head</i> of every convict <i>once a
week</i>. This humiliating process was required by law, but, at the suggestion
of the present keeper, it was so modified, as to leave it to the discretion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
of the keeper to shave or not to shave. The good effects of the measure
were at once manifest. We are not told to what extent the practice now
prevails, but are left to infer that it is only adopted as a mode of punishment.
There can be no doubt, we think, that all methods of humbling or subduing
a convict which savour of vindictiveness, or occasion a needless violation
of a natural and proper self-respect, are to be deprecated. External badges
of infamy and degradation may be needful sometimes as a precaution
against escapes, or for the recapture of convicts, but it is a great advantage
to be able to dispense with them.</p>

<p>The average number of convicts in confinement at the date of the report,
was 161, and the clear profits upon their earnings during the year, were
eight or nine thousand dollars. The bagging business has been found dull,
and very extensive preparations are now made for coopering.</p>

<p>The number of convicts received during the year ending December 1,
1848, was <i>sixty-nine</i>, and the number discharged by pardon during the same
time was <small>THIRTY-THREE</small>, or nearly half as many pardons as commitments.
This number is exclusive of five who were pardoned the day before the expiration
of their sentence, to restore them to citizenship. All the convicts
are males, and only 16 of the 161, are colored; and 128 were convictions of
crime against property, and only twenty-five of the sentences exceed seven
years. Nine of the convicts are from Ireland, and nine from other foreign
countries, leaving 143 native Americans; 97 are under 30 years of age; 114
habitually or occasionally intemperate; 47 utterly destitute of any degree
of education; and 80 were never married. From a review of the prison history
for a period of 13 years, it appears that the largest number received in any
one year, was 81, (1842,) and the smallest, 49, (1837;) the number of convicts
received during the 13 years from the 88 counties of the State, was 877, of
whom 383 were from the county of Jefferson alone, of which Louisville is
the shire-town. Of the 877 convictions, 551 were for crimes against property,
or against the person for property. Of the 877, only eleven were females.
The number of cases of disease occurring during the year, was 244, of
which 128 were cured. Days lost by sickness during the year, 1664.</p>

565 more than were received in 1846. There remained under treatment,
January 1, 1849, 129; and of 2,074 prescribed for during the year, 1,370 were
cured, 147 were relieved, 33 declined treatment, 11 were discharged as incurable,
the result of 34 were not ascertained, and 220 remained under

died. There were in the house, January 1849, 53 children. Dr. Casper
Wistar attended and administered to the institution gratuitously, during a

were under medical care!</p>

furnish the building&mdash;the County Courts during the said time to have power
to make a proportionate reduction of the poor tax in their respective counties.

<p class="figcenter"><img src="images/hr.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="NO_11">No. 11.&mdash;<i>Corrupt Police.</i></h3>

<p>In a charge lately given by one of the Judges of the Court of Quarter
Sessions for the city and county of Philadelphia, some passages occur, the
implication of which is very far from being creditable to the police-gentry,
and is, moreover, rather startling to the lovers of peace and security.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“So long as there is collision between police officers and criminals, crime
will continue, and it will be difficult to suppress it. If police officers will
suppress evidence against the perpetrators of offences; if they will associate
and correspond with criminals, and participate in the fruits of robbery, crime
will continue to increase, because the chances for escape are great. In
some of the <i>Incorporated</i> Districts it is believed, the police force is efficient
and useful.”</p></blockquote>

<p>This makes the whole matter so vague as to aggravate, rather than
alleviate apprehensions.</p>

<p>In the same charge, the magistrate is represented as saying, that “if
there were no pardons there would be but few convictions.” Is it possible
that the indulgence of executive clemency is so frequent as to make
juries careless or forward to convict from the impression that their verdict
will be reviewed under an application for pardon?</p>

<p>We confess we had no idea that the exercise of the pardoning power
had been such, either in character or extent, as to warrant a statement like
the following from the same source:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“If any one will look at the records of conviction throughout the State
for the last fifteen years, and then at the list of pardons, and the history and
convictions of the convicts, it will be found, that rarely has a criminal served
out the period of his sentence, if he were a person of <i>wealth</i> or previous influence,
or who had wealthy connections, or friends and relations of great
political influence. While no one can doubt that every Executive has been
honest and sincere in the exercise of this power, yet the unseen effect of
money and political relations enables the convict to surround the governor
with influences which he does not resist.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Can the yielding to such influences be regarded as consistent with “honesty
and sincerity” in the exercise of the Executive prerogative?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The principles on which pardons are often obtained, are, in my opinion,
incorrect. The Executive generally hears but one side of the case&mdash;the
one presented by the criminal&mdash;while the Court and Jury hear both sides.
The case of the prisoner is always strongly stated in his favor, and that
backed by the influence of friends or <i>hired agents</i>, and the incautious signing
by citizens of a petition for pardon, usually produces the result of a
liberation from that sentence.</p>

<p>“Nothing tends more to the suppression of crime than the certainty of
punishment, no matter how short. Let people once be convinced that
criminals will be punished as the law provides, and we should find the number
of crimes rapidly diminishing.</p></blockquote>

<p>We think much of the principle here asserted, but it is perhaps made to
carry too much weight for its bottom.

<p class="h2">DESIGN AND PLAN OF THE WORK.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The members of this venerable Institution, which has been mainly instrumental, in introducing
the great reform in Prison Discipline that has distinguished the last half century, have long felt the
need of such a medium of communication with the public as is now proposed. Their attention
has of late been more especially aroused to the importance of the measure, from the deep interest
which has been awakened in such reform; and from the misapprehension which prevails, as to the
true principles and results of what is termed the “Pennsylvanian,” or “Separate System.”</p>

<p>Of the intrinsic usefulness of a Journal of this nature, it is believed but one opinion can prevail
among the intelligent and humane. One of the most active and well-informed of those engaged in
the reform of Prisons, has justly remarked, that “judgment is but the result of comparison.” All
reasonable men, before deciding on a measure, will acknowledge the importance of becoming acquainted
with the history and results of similar efforts. Hence the necessity felt by all civilized nations,
of publishing and preserving public documents, reports, discussions, criticisms, &amp;c. In America
there is no adequate provision for the preservation of these, so far as they relate to prison reform;
they are scattered among an accumulation of pamphlets on other subjects, are frequently destroyed,
and are always difficult of access; and the labour which ought to furnish instruction for our future
progress, and for posterity, becomes too often merely temporary in its utility.</p>

<p>At the present time a greatly enhanced importance is attached to a publication of this kind, as a
medium of communication with foreign countries. Several of the governments of Europe are endeavouring
to ascertain the best system of Prison Discipline, with a view to its adoption; and although
the Society have no doubt which of the methods now in existence is the best, some Philanthropists
of the Old World are yet undecided.</p>

<p>It is from a knowledge of these facts and from a belief that it is due to themselves and the cause
of humanity, that the Society have been induced to undertake this publication.</p>

<p>The Journal will be devoted to the exposition and promulgation of correct views on Prison Discipline,
Police systems, Asylums for the insane poor, Societies for the aid of discharged prisoners,
and other reforms immediately connected with these subjects. It will also be rendered more interesting
and instructive by the introduction of biographical sketches of celebrated Philanthropists, accompanied
with portraits; and by plans and descriptions of the best methods of Prison construction.
Such being the object, the Society cannot doubt that it will meet with cordial support from the
friends of humanity, throughout the Old and New World.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p class="h3">TERMS.</p>

<p>This periodical is published quarterly; each number to contain at least 48 pages octavo. It will
be delivered without charge to members of the Society; but to those who are not members, the
price is $1 per aum, always in advance, or 25 cents a number.</p></blockquote>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given

not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
